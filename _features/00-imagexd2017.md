# Day 1, March 29th

## Learn

**Please
[install the required software and datasets](http://www.imagexd.org/2017/03/20/tutorial-materials.html)
prior to the tutorials.**

8:30 - 9:00 : Coffee

9:00–10:00 : [NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib](http://scipy.org), an introduction
to numerical analysis with Python. This tutorial is aimed at those familiar with
Python, but who have not used NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib extensively before.

10:00–11:30 : [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/), image processing in
Python. We introduce the scikit-image library, demonstrate its various
capabilities, and do several hands-on exercises to practice its use.

11:30–12:00 : [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/) for parallel
processing.

12:00–1:00 : Lunch (on your own)

1:00–2:30 : [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), image processing in Java. We
will explore ImageJ and its SciJava interface with examples in Python and
Clojure.

2:30–4:00 : [Vani Mandava](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/vanim/)
from Microsoft Research will present image processing use-cases of the
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) cloud.

4:00–5:00 : [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and
[Keras](https://keras.io/). Deep neural networks in Python. In this tutorial we
learn how to train a neural network using the TensorFlow library, and how to
then apply it to scientific data.

# Day 3, March 31st

## Create

We will get together and work in teams to develop ideas around data,
software, algorithms, and learning. This open format will allow
participants to learn from each other, work together, and explore
concepts that cross domain boundaries.

9:00 - 10:00 : Project ideas discussion

10:00 - 12:00 : Group work

12:00 - 1:00 : Lunch (on your own)

1:00 - 1:30 : Updates

1:30 - 4:30 : Group work

4:30 - 5:00 : Final presentations
