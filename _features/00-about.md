Incredible advances are being made in image processing techniques and tools, but the scientists who use them typically don’t have the opportunity to communicate with scientists who work on similar problems in different domains.

ImageXD comprises researchers from a variety of fields who work with images as a
primary source of data. We work to identify common principles, algorithms, and
tools.  We aim learn from one another while strengthening ties across
disciplinary boundaries.
