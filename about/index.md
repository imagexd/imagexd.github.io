Incredible advances are being made in image processing techniques,
tools, and sampling modalities which, together with an increased
accessibility to modern imaging equipment, has made image data
ubiquitous across many fields, with scales ranging from microscopy to
radio astronomy.

**ImageXD** aims to:

- Fosters a cross-disciplinary community of image processing experts
  from academia, research, and industry.
- Develops a shared understanding of each other's use of image
  processing data, algorithms, and software.
- Learn from one another, through tutorials, and collaborative work
  sessions, about available tools and methods, and the applicability
  of these to various discipline-specific problems.

Our [annual workshop](http://www.imagexd.org/imagexd2018/) is our main avenue
for achieving these aims.
